# Design

The design standards define the visual foundation of the Admin interface, ensuring a consistent and accessible user experience across the application. These guidelines cover the core visual elements that shape how users interact with and navigate the Admin.

## Design topics

*  **[Color](color.md)** — Our color palette reflects our brand personality while meeting accessibility standards and providing clear legibility, hierarchy, navigation, and messaging.

*  **[Iconography](iconography.md)** — Icons provide visual representation of functionality and content throughout the Admin interface, helping users quickly identify actions and navigate sections.

*  **[Page grids](page-grids.md)** — Grid systems establish consistent global layouts for page templates, defining how content and design patterns are organized in columns and rows.

*  **[Typography](typography.md)** — Typography establishes page hierarchy and ensures readability through consistent use of fonts, weights, and sizes across different content types.

These design standards work together with the [Admin Design Pattern Library](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/admin-developer/pattern-library/) to provide comprehensive guidance for creating Admin interfaces.
