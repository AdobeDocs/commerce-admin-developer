# Buttons and links

Buttons are primarily used for task-based navigation, and links are primarily used for site navigation.

However, both buttons and links can function as calls to action (CTAs). Whether button or link, a CTA is used to encourage a user to take an action. CTA labels use title case and active verbs, should be short, and should use labels consistently across the Admin panel.

For more details, see [Title Case standards](capitalization.md#title-case) in Capitalization.

*Examples:*

*  **No** – "Free Demo"
*  Yes – "Sign Up for Free Demo"
*  **No** – "New Rule"
*  Yes – "Add Rule"

## Buttons

Buttons are calls to action, and their labels should be limited to three words (four words maximum, if including a short verb or word).

Buttons can be used for:

*  Calls to action for task flows: to begin, continue, or submit a task
*  Navigation in featured modules of content, like banners and content teasers

Button types are primary, secondary, and tertiary. Each page should have a maximum limit of one primary button. Split buttons include multiple actions. Button counts in a Button Bar or any array of buttons should be limited to four buttons, maximum.

**For design specs,** see [Buttons](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/admin-developer/pattern-library/controls/buttons/) and [Button Bar](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/admin-developer/pattern-library/controls/button-bar/) patterns.

## Links

Minimize the amount of words — within 2-5 words, ideally — in a link label and use best practices in finding optimal keywords.

Other links guidance includes:

*  **Avoid spawning new windows / tabs.** As a general rule, new tabs and windows can confuse users and cause them to close their browser windows. However, exceptions for usage do exist.
*  **External-link icon.** Only use when linking to a non-Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source page. ... *Correct example:* Go to [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)

Links can be used as content links (for site navigation) and non-primary CTAs. When used as CTAs, link labels should be long enough to be understood, but as short as possible. However, a link CTA's label may sometimes stretch a few words longer than a button label.

**For link typography specs,** see [Legal and Link Text](../design/typography.md#legal-and-link-text) in Typography standards.

## Accessibility

*  **Never use "click here" as a label.** Labels should identify and describe the target of the link.
*  **Avoid using file names or URLs as link labels.**
*  **Clearly identify file download links.** Indicate in the label that the user is about to "download" a file.
*  **For anchor links, use "Jump to" before the link.** This identifies the link as an anchor and that it won't navigate users to another page.
*  **Use linked icons with care.** Users may not know what the icon means, so for icons that aren't globally recognized, pair a linked label with a linked icon. See [Iconography standards](../design/iconography.md).

## Labels best practices

*  **Parallelism.** When linking to a page with a direct reference, match the exact wording of the page title or, for anchor tags, the section heading title.
* **PDFs and other file formats.**
   *  Append the document-type acronym after the link label and link only the document title.
   *  Use all caps case and do not add a period to the acronym. See <span markdown="1">[All Caps case standards](capitalization.md#all-caps)</span> in Capitalization.
   *  Do not use the file name or URL in the content &#8212; use the title of the document. For example:
      *  **No** —  "<a href="javascript:void(0);">Download FAQs (.PDF)</a>"
      *  **No** — "<a href="javascript:void(0);">Download FAQs (.pdf)</a>"
      *  **No** — "<a href="javascript:void(0);">Download faqs-bh-v1.pdf</a>"
      *  Yes — <a href="javascript:void(0);">Download FAQs (PDF)</a>"

## When to verify a call to action

For actions like "Delete" and "Cancel", always consider the possibility that the user took the action by mistake.

If the user will lose a lot of work — or if the user's task is not easily recoverable — after taking the action, create an interstitial verify step that happens first when the action is selected.

### Label and content format

Use the following template to create content for a verify step:

*  **Title:** Before you [ Task Label ]
*  **Explainer content:** [ Specify the full implications for the action the user wants to take. ]
*  **Verification content:** Are you sure you want to continue?
*  **Calls to action:** [ Task Label ], Cancel ... *Note:* The "Task Label" is the primary call to action and matches the Title's Task Label.

## Button labels used in Admin

**Specify actions in buttons:** Appending a specific label to a call to action's verb clarifies the action that the user is taking. ... *Example:* "Add Row" is more contextual and understandable than "Add".

The following labels are the standards for Admin labels. Refer to these footnotes for call-to-action hierarchy:

*  `*` — A primary call to action.
*  `**`  — In specific contexts, can be used as a primary call to action.

| Label                           | Usage Guideline                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Add`*` Add [ + Label ]`*`       | Use to create a new object or to add an existing object. As a primary call to action, the label usually matches the page title. "Create [ + Label ]" is also used, but only as an action for creating a new object, not adding an existing one.                                                                             |
| Cancel Cancel [ + Label ]       | In Admin, "Cancel" is used as a link in the Button Bar. Use "Cancel" to end a task flow, with changes unsaved. If the cancellation is not easily recoverable, then include a verify step.                                                                                                                                   |
| Clear Form                      | Use to erase all entries on a form, not to be confused with "Reset [ + Label ]". For actions that are not easily recoverable, include a verify step.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Delete Delete [ + Label ]       | Use to permanently remove an object. If the removal is not easily recoverable, then include a verify step.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Edit Edit [ + Label ]           | When to use "Edit" vs. "Change":<ul><li>Use "Edit" when an object's information is edited.</li><li>Use "Change" when switching from one object to another.</li><li>What's the difference? When users want to change a payment method, they don't want to "Edit" the information for the specified payment method.</li></ul> |
| Continue`*`                     | Use to navigate linear task flows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Filter Apply Filter             | For "Filter", use to select categories to narrow a data set. For "Apply Filter", use to activate the selected filters in the data set. Do not confuse with "Sort".                                                                                                                                                          |
| Get Started`*`                  | Use for a task-entry step (setting expectations and providing prerequisites), before a user has entered a task.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Reset [ + Label ]               | Indicate to users what data is being reset and how the data will reset. For actions that are not easily recoverable, include a verify step. Example: "Reset to Defaults". Do not confuse with "Clear Form".                                                                                                                 |
| Save`**` Save [ + Label ]`**`   | Use to capture changes or to submit an entry. "Save" is usually use a secondary task, when a user wants to save changes and not continue, but "Save" can be used as a primary call to action, in Admin.                                                                                                                     |
| Search`*`                       | Use for search tasks, not filter tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Sort                            | Use to select a category from which to sort data, not to be confused with "Filter".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Submit`*` Submit [ + Label ]`*` | Use to complete a task or to submit it for completion. Insert the specific name of task as the label to clarify for users what they are submitting.                                                                                                                                                                         |
