# Capitalization

The application uses three different cases for content – sentence case, title case, and all-caps.

Use the following standards for usage and keep in mind a few key terms' capitalization rules.

## Sentence case

Use as default content style, where a grammatically correct sentence starts with an initially capitalized word and ends with a punctuation mark. For exceptions, see Title-Case and All-Caps standards that follow.

Pay attention to common terms – some may be mistaken for proper nouns.

However, many terms use lowercase including: merchant, developer, home page, static blocks, invoice, order, and panel.

## Title case

### 'Use For ...'

*  **Headings.** See more Headings guidance.
*  **Button labels and links.** ONLY use title case when a link are used as a call to action. See more Buttons and Links Usage guidance.

### 'Capitalize ...'

- **The first letter of the first and last words.**
- **The second word of a compound, hyphenated word.** Exception: When the first word in the hyphenation is not a prefix.  
  *Prefix examples:* anti-, pre-, post-  
  *Examples:*
  - **No** – "Best-rated Platform Software"
  - Yes – "Best-Rated Platform Software"

  - **No** – "Post-Launch Instructions"
  - Yes – "Post-launch Instructions"

- **All verbs.**
  - *Capitalize even the little ones.*
  - *Correct examples:* Is, Am, Are, Was, Were, Be, Being, and Been.

- **All parts of verbs.** Includes prepositions, if they are part of a phrasal verb. *Correct example:* "Turn On".

  - *Tip:* If you emphasize the word when reading it aloud, then capitalize it.
  - *Infinitives are not verbs:* See infinitives guidance, jump to the ["Do Not capitalize ..."](capitalization.md#do-not-capitalize-) section.

  *Examples:*
  - **No** – "Turning Blocks on and off"
  - Yes – "Turning Blocks On and Off"
  - Yes – "Setting Up a Catalog"

- **Conjunctions.** ... *Correct examples:* and, but, for, or, nor
- **Prepositions of fewer than four letters.** Includes the "to" in infinitives. *See example:*
  
  - **No** – "The Key To Customer Service In An Omnichannel World"
  - Yes – "The Key to Customer Service in an Omnichannel World"

- **Brand or company names that use a lowercase initial letter.** ... *Tip:* Rephrase a heading or sentence to avoid starting with a lowercase letter. *See example:*
  
  - **No** – "EBay, IPod, IPhone"
  - Yes – "eBay, iPod, iPhone"
