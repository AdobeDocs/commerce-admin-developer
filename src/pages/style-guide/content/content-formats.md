# Content formats

For more specifics, use the [Glossary](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/implementation-playbook/glossary). If an item is not found, refer to the Associated Press (AP) Stylebook on first reference, and the Microsoft Manual of Style on second reference.

## Abbreviations

Avoid the following:

*  **Abbreviations for months and URLs.**  For details, see the [Dates](number-formats.md#dates-and-times) section in Number Formats.

*  **Non-English words and abbreviations.** These are difficult to translate, and some users might be unfamiliar with them.

*  **Latin abbreviations.** Abbreviations like i.e., e.g., and etc., are not universally known and are often misunderstood.

## Acronyms

When in doubt, spell it out. If there's a chance a reader doesn't know an abbreviation or acronym, use the full term on first reference.

*  **Use all caps case.**

*  **First reference, spelled out.** Spell out term and append acronym in parenthesis. *Correct examples:* content management system (CMS), Social Security Number (SSN)

*  **Second reference format.** Replace term and use only acronym. *Correct example:* "When you sign into the content management system (CMS), enter the new content into the CMS."

*  **First reference, acronym only.** Some acronyms are used by themselves because they're better-known than their spelled-out terms. These acronyms are used on first reference. *Correct examples:* DVD, ZIP Code, XML, API

### File-Type Formats

*  Do not use a period or other punctuation before or after the file name.

   Examples:

   *  **No** - "Pdf, Tiff, Html, Jpg, Css, Xml"
   *  **No** - ".pdf, .tiff, .html, .jpg, xss, .xml"
   *  **Yes** - "PDF, TIFF, HTML, JPG, CSS, XML"

*  Link format: Append the file type in parenthesis after the file name. For more details, see the [Labels Best Practices](buttons-and-links.md#labels-best-practices) section in Buttons and Links Usage.

## Addresses

For United States, use these formats:

| Basic | International| Basic +\<br /\>Company Name| Basic +\<br /\>Address Line 2|
|-------|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Ray Symmetry\<br /\>1234 Barnacle Dr.\<br /\>Enid, TX 73701 | Ray Symmetry\<br /\>1234 Barnacle Dr.\<br /\>Enid, TX 73701\<br /\>USA | Ray Symmetry\<br /\>Company Name\<br /\>1234 S Barnacle Dr.\<br /\>Enid, TX 73701 | Ray Symmetry\<br /\>1234 Barnacle Dr.\<br /\>PO Box 1234\<br /\>Enid, TX 73701  |

## Lists

Use a bulleted list when a sentence includes a series or especially when it includes a series of complex phrases or clauses.

Breaking up items in a series into lists will enhance readability for users and enable them to better scan and find information.

Use these rules for lists:

*  **Introducing a list.** All lists must be preceded by a lead-in heading, sentence or phrase, as follows:

   *  A heading / title without punctuation

   *  A sentence that ends in a colon or ellipsis

   *  A phrase, or partial sentence, ending in a colon or ellipsis

*  **Bullets vs. numbers.** Use bullets for non-sequential lists and numbers for sequential lists or instructions.

*  **Capitalization.** Each item in a list should begin with a capitalized letter in the first word.

*  **Periods.** Use for items that are complete sentences, wholly contained within the bullet / number. Can be used for bold lead-in content. See examples below.

*  **Parallelism.** List elements should be constructed consistently. If the first item in a list is a noun, all items must be nouns. Similarly, if the first item is a sentence, all items must be sentences.
