# Admin Style Guide

The Admin guide sets our foundational design, writing, and content standards for the [Admin](https://glossary.magento.com/magento-admin) software. For more specific user-interface standards, see the [Admin Design Pattern Library](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/pattern-library/bk-pattern.html).

**Why follow the style guide?** A style guide is the best tool for designers and writers to establish and maintain consistency, which improves communication throughout the application. A seamless look-and-feel and a steady, encouraging writing style make the application usable and engaging.

**To get started or refresh your knowledge,** read the following documents:

## Design

*  **[Color](design/color.md)** — Reflects our brand personality, meeting accessibility standards.

*  **[Iconography](design/iconography.md)** — Provides a visual representation of functionality or content, usually paired and displayed with a label.

*  **[Page Grid](design/page-grids.md)** — Establishes global layouts for page templates and how content and design patterns can be placed in the grids' columns.

*  **[Typography](design/typography.md)** — Sets page hierarchy and content type specifications.

## Writing and Content

*  **[Voice and Tone](content/voice-and-tone.md)** — Outlines a set of ground rules to engage and empower users as they navigate the Admin and perform tasks with confidence and ease.

*  **[Errors and Messages Writing](content/errors-and-messages.md)** — Establishes how to communicate with users when errors occur or important information needs to be communicated.

*  **[Buttons and Links Usage](content/buttons-and-links.md)** — Defines the differences between buttons and links and when they can be used as calls to action.

*  **[Capitalization](content/capitalization.md)** — Provides guidance for how we use sentence case, title case, and all caps.

*  **[Headings and Organization](content/headings-and-organization.md)** — Prioritizes content and creates a hierarchy for users to easily navigate Admin.

*  **[Content Formats](content/content-formats.md)** — Standardizes abbreviations, acronyms, file-type formats, addresses, and lists.

*  **[Number Formats](content/number-formats.md)** — Lists basic numeric and heading standards and covers percentages, money, and dates and times.
